# Basic Deep Q-Network

An implementation of a basic deep Q-network. The core of this follows the description in the [blog](https://becominghuman.ai/lets-build-an-atari-ai-part-0-intro-to-rl-9b2c5336e0ec), which uses DeepMind's paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf). My DQN is pretty basic, and doesn't use all of the impovements discussed in the blog and paper. As a result, it converges very slowly!

## Setup

This library requires:
- gym (including atari_py)
- Tensorflow (& keras)

## Contains
